String Patter matchingv :
  - line. The strings
    have no fixed length, and the files vary in size from anywhere between 0MB and 1000MB. The
    files are plain text files, and contain only lowercase letters, square brackets, and new lines.
    A pattern occurs within some of the strings, whereby a pair of two different letters are followed
    by the reverse of that pair, making short sequences of four characters, e.g. “xaax” or “bccb”.
